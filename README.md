# Coati Every Hour!

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

- Script that tweets a picture of a coati every hour on the hour. Script searches
the internet for pictures of coatiss, uses machine learning to make sure the image
is of a coati. It then uses an average hash to compare it to other images tweeted
to make sure it's original.
